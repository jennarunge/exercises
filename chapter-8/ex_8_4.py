# Programming Exercise 8-4
#
# Program to convert text to Morse code.
# This program prompts the user for a string of characters,
# then chooses a Morse character for each character to build an output string,
# and displays the output string on the screen.



# Define the main function

    # Define local variables for input string, morse string and morse index (integer)

    
    # Define a list of Morse codes for each allowable character

    
    # Get the input string from the user.


    # Iterate over the characters in the input string with a for loop

        # Convert the current character to uppercase.
 
        # use if..else logic to find each character's Morse code index in the list,
        
        # add the Morse code for the character to the morse string


    # Display the morse string



# Call the main function to start the program
