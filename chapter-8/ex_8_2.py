# Programming Exercise 8-2
#
# Program to total all the digits in a sequence of digits.
# This program prompts a user for a sequence of digits as a single string,
# calls a function to iterates through the characters and total their values,
# then displays the total.



# Define the main function

    # Define local variables: an int to hold total and a string to hold input


    # Get a string of digits as input from the user


    # pass input to a function to sum the digits; assign the return value to total


    # Display the total.



# Define a function to sum the digits in a string of digits
# This funtion receives a string of digits as a parameter,
# loops through the characters, converting them to integers and totaling them,
# then returns the total as an integer.

    # Define local integer variables for total and digit value


    # loop through each character in the string.

        # if the character is a digit,

            # Convert the character to an integer and assign to digit value

        # Add digit value to total.


    # Return the total.



# Call the main function to start the program.
