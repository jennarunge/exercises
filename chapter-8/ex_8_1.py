# Programming Exercise 8-1
#
# Program to extract initials from a person's name.
# This program prompts a user for his or her full name,
# Splits the name into a list of parts and extracts the first character from each,
# and displays the characters in upper case, followed by periods.

# Define the main function
def main():
    
    # Get a full name as user input
    name = input("Enter your full name: ")

    # Split the string on spaces into a list of name parts and assign to a variable
    

    # iterate over each name part in the list

        # display the first character ( parts[0] ) of the name part as upper case

        # follow the character with a period (all these should be on the same line)


        
# Call the main function.
main()
